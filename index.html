                        <p class="first-paragraph">Jack Sparrow was a legendary pirate of the Seven Seas, and the
                            irreverent trickster of
                            the Caribbean. A captain of equally dubious morality and sobriety, a master of
                            self-promotion and self-interest, Jack fought a constant and losing battle with his own
                            best tendencies. Whether by cause or accident, he was the quickest to seize the moment
                            and make it his own. Captain Jack's first love was the sea, his second, his beloved ship
                            the Black Pearl.
                        </p><br />

                        <p>The son of Captain Edward Teague, Jack was born on a pirate ship in a typhoon. Before he
                            became known as "Captain Jack Sparrow" he was simply known as Jack Sparrow, a teenage
                            stowaway who, even then, had a desire for adventure. Young Jack first sailed on the Barnacle
                            with a ragtag crew on a quest to locate and procure the legendary Sword of Cortés. A few
                            years after his teenage adventures, an encounter with the infamous rogue pirates forced Jack
                            to abandon the pirate life and take employment in the East India Trading Company. After five
                            years of faithful service, during which he sailed across all the Seven Seas, he was given
                            command of the Wicked Wench, a ship owned by Cutler Beckett, the EITC Director for West
                            Africa. As Beckett's employee, Sparrow searched for the mystical island of Kerma and its
                            treasure, until he decided to betray Beckett and keep the island and its inhabitants safe
                            from Beckett and his slave traders. When Beckett contracted him to transport a cargo of
                            slaves to the Bahamas, Sparrow chose to liberate them and steal the Wench from Beckett.
                            However, Beckett's men managed to find him and branded him as a pirate, while the Wench was
                            set aflame and sunk. After striking a bargain with the fearsome Davy Jones, the ghastly
                            captain of the ghostly Flying Dutchman, to raise his beloved vessel from the depths, Jack
                            had the Wicked Wench renamed the Black Pearl and began the pirate life anew. At some point,
                            Jack Sparrow became one of the nine Pirate Lords, his domain being the Caribbean Sea.
                        </p><br />

                        <p>Throughout his years as an infamous pirate of the Caribbean, Captain Jack Sparrow embarked on
                            many adventures. He was captain of the Black Pearl for two years, during which time he
                            searched for the Shadow Gold. But when he was going after the treasure of Isla de Muerta,
                            Jack lost the Pearl in a mutiny led by his first mate, Captain Hector Barbossa. Ten years
                            later, with the help of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, Jack retrieved the Black Pearl,
                            upon having killed the cursed Barbossa, thereby becoming its captain once again. Captain
                            Sparrow soon sought to seize the Dead Man's Chest, to settle his debt with Davy Jones, which
                            ended with both captain and ship being taken to Davy Jones' Locker by the Kraken. Following
                            a desperate quest to rescue Sparrow from the Locker led by the resurrected Hector Barbossa,
                            the Brethren Court convened in one last stand against Lord Cutler Beckett, who had control
                            over Davy Jones and the Flying Dutchman, which led to a pirate showdown with the East India
                            Company. Jack later sailed on stranger tides during the quest for the fabled Fountain of
                            Youth. Forced aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, Sparrow must contend with the notorious
                            Blackbeard, his beautiful daughter Angelica, zombies, mermaids, and a rendezvous with
                            Barbossa. Later, pursued by the malicious Captain Salazar and a crew of deadly ghosts who
                            escaped from the Devil's Triangle, a down-on-his-luck Captain Jack sought to reverse his
                            recent spate of ill fortune by finding the Trident of Poseidon. In an uneasy alliance with
                            Henry Turner, who sought to free his cursed father Will, and Carina Smyth, a brilliant
                            astronomer and Barbossa's daughter, Sparrow was able to find the Trident and defeat Salazar
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            Over the course of time, Captain Jack Sparrow became a center of intrigue as myths and
                            legends have been told of his exploits. Most of these tales, however, were exaggerations, or
                            even fabrications, embellished by the famed pirate himself to bolster his reputation. He
                            also navigated his way from one perilous adventure to another, enemies became allies and
                            friends became foes. Despite his dishonesty and many deceptions, Jack Sparrow did embark on
                            a number of grand and thrilling adventures, some involving the supernatural, pirate lore,
                            magic, and journeys in discovering hidden treasures. Indeed, Jack's ultimate ambition was to
                            have the freedom to sail the seas as a legendary pirate for eternity.

                        <p class="first-paragraph">Hector Barbossa was a legendary and ferocious pirate of the
                            Caribbean. A captain of
                            treacherous morality, a vile pirate returned from the dead, and a master of his own fate,
                            Barbossa was the ultimate survivor. Not one to be trusted, he tends to honor the Pirate's
                            Code only when it suits him. Ruthless and cunning, combining experience with reckless
                            daring, Barbossa was also a deadly enemy and nemesis to Captain Jack Sparrow.
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            In his youth, Hector Barbossa was an honest sailor who left to make an easier living as a
                            pirate. Originally a captain of the schooner Cobra, Hector would join the crew aboard the
                            Black Pearl as Captain Jack Sparrow's first mate. After a while of sailing under Sparrow,
                            Barbossa led a mutiny against Jack and marooned him before finding the treasure of Cortés in
                            Isla de Muerta. Through unknown and mysterious circumstances, Barbossa would eventually
                            become the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea having obtained the Piece of Eight of the previous
                            Pirate Lord. Upon falling under the Aztec Curse, Captain Barbossa led his cursed crew in a
                            quest to restore all the scattered pieces of the Aztec gold they frittered away, and the
                            blood to be repaid. Ironically, after Barbossa sent former crewman Bootstrap Bill Turner
                            down to the crushing oblivion of Davy Jones' Locker, the crew realized they needed
                            Bootstrap's blood to lift their terrible curse. Ten years later, believing Elizabeth
                            "Turner" was the child of Bootstrap Bill, Barbossa kidnapped her in the crew's final step in
                            freeing themselves from the curse. Unfortunately, the curse was lifted by the real child of
                            Bootstrap Bill Turner, Will Turner, at which time Barbossa was killed at Isla de Muerta by
                            his old captain, Jack Sparrow.
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            Even death was not the end of Captain Barbossa, as he was later resurrected by the voodoo
                            priestess Tia Dalma, secretly the sea goddess Calypso in human form. The two struck a
                            bargain, in which Barbossa helped free the goddess from her human bonds in return for his
                            resurrection In an uneasy alliance, Barbossa led the quest to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy
                            Jones' Locker and later convened the Brethren Court in a war against Lord Cutler Beckett,
                            who had control over Davy Jones and the Flying Dutchman. After the pirate showdown with the
                            East India Trading Company, Barbossa stole the Black Pearl from Jack once again. However,
                            Barbossa had lost the Pearl and his right leg in an attack by the fearsome pirate
                            Blackbeard. At some point later, Hector served as a privateer in King George II's court,
                            claiming to owe his allegiance to King and Country. He abandoned his pirate regalia and
                            started wearing a British Royal Navy uniform as well as sporting a wooden leg. Under the
                            command of Hector Barbossa, the HMS Providence sailed forth without fear on stranger tides
                            during the quest for the Fountain of Youth, where the navy captain would rendezvous with
                            Jack Sparrow, Blackbeard and destiny. Ultimately, after joining forces with Sparrow, Hector
                            revealed it was revenge rather than valor that pushed Barbossa toward the Fountain, as he
                            held a grudge against Blackbeard.
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            In the aftermath of the battle that saw Barbossa mortally wounding Blackbeard, the former
                            privateer of the King claimed the infamous pirate's ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, as well
                            as his crew and magical sword. Returning to piracy, Captain Barbossa made himself the
                            scourge of the New World, leading a pirate fleet of ten ships that ruled the Caribbean Sea.
                            However, the return of the malicious Capitán Salazar and his crew of deadly ghosts
                            threatened Barbossa's rule of the sea. Although the Spanish pirate hunter initially forced
                            old pirate to help him find Jack Sparrow, Hector allied himself with Jack once again to
                            search for the legendary Trident of Poseidon. Along the way, Barbossa learned that Carina, a
                            brilliant astronomer who was in possession of the Map No Man Can Read, was his long-lost
                            daughter. With the Black Pearl restored, released from a bottle and grown to full size,
                            Hector, Jack, and Carina were able to find the Trident and defeat Salazar.
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            By the time Carina became aware of her familial connection with Hector, the weathered sea
                            captain would sacrifice himself by piercing Salazar through the back, thereby saving his
                            "treasure." Carina watched in disbelief, tears in her eyes as her father disappeared beneath
                            the water and collapsing waves. Captain Hector Barbossa's notorious reign of the sea had
                            finally come to an end, though the old pirate's legacy lived on through his daughter, who
                            adopted the Barbossa family name.

                        <p class="first-paragraph">Davy Jones was the ruler of the Seven Seas, a supernatural force
                            condemned for eternity to captain the Flying Dutchman. Once a man who "ran afoul of that
                            which vexes all men," Jones became as much sea creature as he was human. A fearsome captain,
                            a ruthless and heartless beast, striking terror into the bravest of sailors as the devil of
                            the deep, he became the stuff of various myths and legends of Pirate Lore, particularly
                            relating to the Dutchman and Davy Jones' Locker.
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            In one particular legend, Davy Jones was a great sailor until he fell in love with the sea
                            goddess Calypso. He would be given the Flying Dutchman as well as the sacred task of
                            ferrying souls who died at sea to the worlds beyond. Because of that love, Davy Jones agreed
                            to set foot on land once every ten years, where Jones would be free to be with Calypso. But
                            when Davy Jones came ashore after his ten year duty, he was forsaken by Calypso, who was
                            nowhere to be found. So, when the First Brethren Court convened, Davy Jones plotted with
                            them to tear the rule of the seas away from Calypso, in which the Brethren imprisoned her
                            into the body of a mortal woman. Jones was the one who told the Brethren how to bind Calypso
                            into human form; he never stopped loving her, but the pain it caused him was too much to
                            live with. Soon Jones' guilt became so great, he carved out his own heart and locked it away
                            in the Dead Man's Chest. He kept the key with him at all times and the location of the chest
                            a closely guarded secret
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            Abandoning his duty, Davy Jones then returned to the seven seas, only now sailors everywhere
                            would fear him to the death, for Jones had turned fierce and cruel, with an insatiable taste
                            for all things brutal. He became a nightmarish creature; half human, half sea beast, a crab
                            claw for an arm, and a beard made of octopus tentacles. As the legendary ruler of the ocean
                            depths, Davy Jones preyed on wayward sailors lost at sea with the Flying Dutchman, now a
                            cursed ghost ship. Jones also commanded the Kraken, an ancient and horrible squid-like beast
                            of the sea, which brought the captain of the Dutchman ever more souls into joining his crew.
                            Those who wished to avoid death and final judgment would agree to serve Jones aboard his
                            haunted vessel, eventually becoming a part of the ship itself, forever enslaved to its
                            terrifying captain.
                        </p><br />

                            At some point in time, Davy Jones would strike a bargain with Jack Sparrow to resurrect his
                            beloved vessel the Wicked Wench, which he would rename as the Black Pearl, in return for a
                            hundred years of servitude aboard the Dutchman. That debt would be settled thirteen years
                            later, in which Jones sent Bootstrap Bill Turner to give Jack the Black Spot, which drew the
                            Kraken. Several days later, in which Jones dealt with Bootstrap Bill's son Will Turner, the
                            debt was ultimately settled with Jack and the Pearl being dragged to the depths by the
                            Kraken. But it was in vain as Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company came
                            into possession of Davy Jones' still-beating heart, forcing Jones and his crew to do his
                            bidding. With the Flying Dutchman under Beckett's control, Davy Jones would lead the EITC
                            Armada in the fight against the Fourth Brethren Court.

                            While the Brethren convened, Jones reunited with Calypso, who intended to be free and punish
                            the Brethren, until realizing Jones' betrayal. Upon being freed, the enraged goddess
                            Calypso, in her wrath, created a massive maelstrom, where a battle raged at the center of
                            it. And it was in that very battle that Davy Jones' heart was pierced and he died, finally
                            free. With his death, Davy Jones was welcomed back into the dark embrace of the sea that he
                            had been in love with, albeit only for a short period, as he mysteriously reappeared on land
                            two decades later.

                        <p class="first-paragraph">Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, was a notorious pirate who
                            operated in the West
                            Indies throughout the 18th century, specifically during the 1750s. The blackest soul and the
                            darkest heart of any pirate who ever lived, striking fear into the bravest of sailors,
                            Blackbeard was a name uttered in terror by all who sail the sea, or any unfortunate enough
                            to encounter him on dry land. Blackbeard's many exploits became the stuff of various myths
                            and legends of pirate lore, including the legend of being killed and beheaded by Royal
                            Marines during the battle of Ocracoke Inlet in 1718.

                        <p>
                            Originally an Englishman who began his career as one of the many privateers dispensed by
                            King George to raid enemy ships during war, it wasn't until he struck out as a free agent
                            that his true legend was born. He became a renowned pirate, his cognomen derived from his
                            thick black beard and fearsome appearance. His best known vessel was his flagship, the Queen
                            Anne's Revenge, a fearsome frigate festooned with the bones of his victims and spits Greek
                            fire from its bow to incinerate enemy ships or the occasional crew member fallen out of
                            favor. Blackbeard was known to be incredibly cruel to his own crew, more so than the people
                            he held captive, and occasionally murdered men just so they could remember who he was. He
                            resurrected some of the men he killed into obedient zombie officers. Blackbeard also had
                            supernatural powers, having dabbled in the Black Arts and wielded a sword embedded with one
                            of the three sapphires of Triton, which he used to control ships. He would turn every
                            captured vessel into individual ships in bottles and kept each as a prize for his
                            collection. Through unknown circumstances, Blackbeard would have reunited with his beloved
                            daughter Angelica, who served as his first mate aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            In his later life, Blackbeard lived under the shadow of a prophesied death at the hands of a
                            one-legged man named Hector Barbossa, predicted by his zombie Quartermaster. His only hope
                            was to find the restorative waters of the fabled Fountain of Youth. Whatever happened
                            beneath the weight of his heartless ambition, Blackbeard would try and reach the Fountain by
                            any means. After Jack Sparrow was forced aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, Blackbeard
                            embarked on the quest for the Fountain, where he would rendezvous with fate. With Sparrow's
                            help, he and his crew found the Fountain, but the British Royal Navy soldiers led by
                            Barbossa and the Spanish crew led by The Spaniard appeared on scene and started a sanguinary
                            battle in which Blackbeard was fatally wounded by Barbossa and subsequently ended up losing
                            his life due to Jack Sparrow's lies to drink from the wrong Chalice.

                        <p class="first-paragraph">Armando Salazar was the legendary and terrifying pirate hunter who
                            haunted the Caribbean.
                            Hailing from Spain, Salazar was a Spaniard, a man whose family was destroyed by pirates when
                            he was a child. Obsessed with vengeance, he became a high-ranking officer of the Spanish
                            Royal Navy and the decorated Capitán of the powerful pirate-hunting galleon, the Silent
                            Mary. For many years, Salazar terrorized the seas, hunting and killing thousands of pirates
                            until his spectacular fall from grace when a young pirate named Jack Sparrow outsmarted the
                            ruthless Butcher of the Sea and led him to his death in the mysterious Devil's Triangle.

                        <p>
                            However, through the dark powers of the Triangle, Salazar was resurrected more powerful than
                            ever, but cursed to wander the world as a ghost for eternity. In addition, Salazar and his
                            crew could not escape from the Triangle, while being forced to live in it and slaughter
                            anyone who entered it, causing legends to originate about why no ship that sailed into the
                            Triangle ever sailed out.
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            Decades after their imprisonment, Salazar and his crew of deadly ghost sailors were released
                            from the Triangle's relentless hold when Jack Sparrow sold his compass to acquire a bottle
                            of rum, although he later recovered it. Hungry for revenge, Salazar led his crew on a
                            mission of vengeance to obtain the legendary Trident of Poseidon to finally eliminate
                            pirates and kill Jack Sparrow in order to avenge the life that was taken from him. During
                            the search for the Trident, Salazar made an unholy alliance with the Queen Anne's Revenge's
                            captain Hector Barbossa and was able to corner Sparrow and his party at Hangman's Bay.
                            Later, during the race to the Black rock island where Poseidon's Tomb was located, Salazar
                            managed to destroy Lieutenant John Scarfield's ship Essex in order to wipe out the English
                            from the search and captured Henry Turner following a brief duel with Sparrow. During the
                            ensuing battle for the Trident, Turner destroyed the Trident and Salazar regained his human
                            form along his crew, only to be wounded by Barbossa during his attempt to board the Black
                            Pearl via its anchor. He hit the anchor face first and was washed away with his remaining
                            crew when the ocean closed.
